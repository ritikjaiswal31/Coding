Coding Repository
Welcome to the Coding and LeetCode Problem of the Day Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of daily coding challenges and LeetCode problems to hone your programming skills and algorithmic problem-solving abilities.

Overview
This repository is aimed at providing you with a structured approach to practice coding and improve your problem-solving skills. Each day, a new coding challenge or LeetCode problem will be posted for you to solve. These challenges cover various difficulty levels and topics, including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

Getting Started
To get started with solving the daily problems, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
https://github.com/ritikjaiswal31/Coding-Repository.git
Navigate to the Problem Directory: Each day's problem will be organized into its own directory within the repository. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the current date.

Read the Problem Description: Open the problem description file (problem.md or similar) to understand the problem statement and any constraints.

Solve the Problem: Write your solution to the problem in your preferred programming language. You can create a new file within the problem directory to hold your solution.

Test Your Solution: Test your solution with various test cases to ensure it works correctly. You can create a separate file for test cases or include them in your solution file.

Submit Your Solution: Once you're confident in your solution, you can submit it by creating a pull request (PR) to this repository. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines provided in the repository.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute a new problem or suggest improvements, please follow these guidelines:

New Problems: If you'd like to contribute a new coding problem or LeetCode challenge, create a new directory within the problems folder and include the problem description (problem.md), sample input/output files, and any additional resources or hints.
